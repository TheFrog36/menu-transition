- Try to use css property "counter" instead of --i.
- How hard is to make the bar dot transparent?
- Move the sun in the current position, then make it set or rise slowly, for 
  extra satisfaction
- Make bars gap in function of the actual --gap
  This will require to recalculate the length when at 45deg based on --gap
  Alsoalso the bottom pos of each bar at 45deg.

- Currently just make the sun.
    - Create each section individually, then put them in divs w/ flex so u can use
      the gap as the actual gap
